    <h3>Importing Decklist</h3>
    <p>
        To get started, you need to import your deck from a deck builder, like TappedOut or Archidekt. The import list must be in the following format:<br>
        <code>1 Card Name<br>3 Card Name</code><br>
        Click the <strong>Import</strong> button to load the specified cards.
    </p>
    <br>
    
    <h3>Choosing a Commander</h3>
    <p>
        Once the cards have loaded, you will need to pick a commander for your deck. The first section of the card viewer will show a list of legal commanders
        from the imported cards as long as no commander is selected. To choose a commander, click the <mat-icon>security</mat-icon> icon below the card. To deselect a commander
        and move the card back to the main deck, click the <mat-icon>person_remove</mat-icon> icon. The app supports adding multiple commanders, but does not
        check for the legality of your deck.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h3>Choosing Card Art</h3>
    <p>
        Clicking the <mat-icon>style</mat-icon> icon below a card will load a list of all printings of that card. Swapping between the printings will update the
        image in real-time. Additionally, you may choose the image quality of your card art by selecting an option from the <strong>Quality</strong> dropdown above the card
        viewer.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Tip: </strong>After clicking the <mat-icon>style</mat-icon> icon, use the up and down arrow keys to quickly switch card arts.</p>
    <br>

    <h3>Tokens</h3>
    <p>
        When loading the cards from the deck list, the app will also load any associated tokens that are created by cards in the deck list. You can change
        the art of these tokens just like a normal card.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Tip: </strong>Each section of the card viewer is collapsible. To see the tokens without scrolling too far, collapse the <strong>Main Deck</strong> section.</p>
    <br>

    <h3>Card Backs</h3>
    <p>
        To use a custom card back when exporting, insert a link to an image url in the <strong>Card Back Image URL</strong> field, above the card viewer. A preview of the image
        will be displayed in the <strong>Card Back</strong> section of the card viewer if a valid image is provided. The default MTG card back will be used if no url is given.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h3>Exporting a Deck</h3>
    <p>
        Once you are satisfied with your deck, give it a name and click the <strong>Export</strong> button to download a .json file containing
        the deck object format for Tabletop Simulator. To import the deck in TTS, find the downloaded file and move it to your TTS Saved Objects folder:<br>
        <code>Documents > My games > Tabletop Simulator > Saves > Saved Objects</code><br>
        In Tabletop Simulator, the deck object should now show up in the <code>Objects > Saved Objects</code> menu. Drag the object onto your table, and your cards
        should appear. There will be multiple piles:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Main Deck</li>
        <li>Commander(s)</li>
        <li>Tokens</li>
        <li>Double-Sided Cards</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
    <p>
        If you run into any issues while using the app, you can help me identify the errors. If a card fails to import, or you notice other weird behaviors within the app,
        open up the dev tools console by pressing <strong>F12</strong>. Check the console tab for any red error messages and send me a screenshot.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you have an issue with your cards loading in TTS, send me your deck list so that I can investigate the issue locally.
